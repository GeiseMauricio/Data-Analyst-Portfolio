Credit Card Fraud Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The objective is to explore the data, understand fraud patterns, deal with extreme class imbalance, and prepare the dataset for modeling, following industry-standard best practices.

The project is designed to be reproducible, well-structured, and portfolio-ready, showcasing skills expected from a Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist.

🎯 Objectives
Explore and understand credit card transaction data
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on fraud detection
Analyze and visualize class imbalance
Prepare clean and processed datasets for modeling
Build a clear and reproducible analysis pipeline

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Download link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download]
Dataset Description
Transactions made by European cardholders

Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud ≈ 0.17% of transactions)

Features anonymized using PCA

Target variable:

Class = 1 → Fraud
Class = 0 → Legitimate transaction
⚠️ Raw Data Policy
The raw dataset file (creditcard.csv) is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limits.

To run the project locally:

Download the dataset from Kaggle using the link above

Place the file in the following path:

data/raw/creditcard.csv
🔍 Analysis Highlights
Overview of dataset structure and summary statistics
